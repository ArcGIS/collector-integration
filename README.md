## Documentation

####Collector URL scheme overview

A URL scheme allows you to launch a native app from another app, website, or email. You can set options in the URL that will be passed to the app you want to open, causing it to perform specific functions, such as opening a web map and centering the map on a given location.  This capability is available on all platforms.

####Basic Collector URL scheme structure

All Collector URL schemes start with the identifier `arcgis-collector` and can contain additional parameters that follow the form:

`
arcgis-collector://?parameter=value&parameter=value
`

The remainder of this topic describes the various parameters Collector currently supports.

####Open a web map 

This is one of the simplest schemes that can be used. The following example URL scheme demonstrates how to open a specific map within Collector.

`itemID`: The web map to open in Collector.  

The following example URL defines opening a web map:

```
arcgis-collector://?itemID=35b1ccecf226485ea7d593f100996b49 
```

####Center at a given location

The location on which to center the map.  

`center`: (*optional*) Specified as a set of latitude, longitude (y,x) coordinates. Coordinates must be in WGS84. 

The following example URL defines a map to open and a location to center the map:

```
arcgis-collector://?itemID=35b1ccecf226485ea7d593f100996b49&center=34.0547155,-117.1961714
```

####Scale for provided location

The scale for the given location.  

`scale`: If coordinates are being sent, an optional scale can be specified for the initial zoom to the center point instead of max scale (*optional*)

The following example URL defines a map to open and a location to center and scale the map:

```
arcgis-collector://?itemID=35b1ccecf226485ea7d593f100996b49&center=34.0547155,-117.1961714&scale=2500
```

####Errors
If an error is encountered when processing a URL scheme, the user will receive an alert.
